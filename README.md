Software Engineer at Holiday Extras, working across the frontend and backend with React and Node.js.

Before moving into software, I spent 10 years leading a video and photography production team, handling strategy, recruitment, and project management.

I like working in fast-moving teams, solving tricky problems, and making things work better.
